# Bug Bounty

The [Metis bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/metis/) is focused around our smart contracts.

**Smart Contracts and Blockchain**

| Level |  |

| Critical | up to USD $1,000,000 |
| High | USD $30,000 |
| Medium | USD $5,000 |

All bug reports must include a Proof of Concept demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited to be eligible for a reward. This may be a smart contract itself or a transaction.

All payouts are done by the **Metis** team and are pegged to the **USD** values and are payable in **METIS**.
